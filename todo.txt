4. avoid callback hell, write nice awai asycn func
5. Github! 
    at readme, write variant of case, how could these be useful

================
CURRENT CAVEAT: 
================
1. conversation could be cutted for first time 
(because if update, automate get the last time stamp)
(except the rule apply only when they start using, the tweet start from 0)
temporary: before update, remind people to wait +- 1 minute
good solution: always check the conversation_id ? 
    let people update individual post(based on conversation id)

1. test aren thread. what if each tweet on threda have image. what will happen?

2. blog not make sense if you reply on reply people
    (prevent reply onpeople's reply as thread)

3. if quoted
    -> embed tweet at render? using the link?

============================================================
Alpha 0.1 :: 
    JUST PROTOTYPE, SEE HOW PEOPLE RESPOND
============================================================
Goal: just to share code on twitter and github (add portofolio)
ONLY PUBLISH IF: update new content works.
